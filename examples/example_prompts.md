# Example Project Description Prompts

Here are some example project descriptions you can use with the AI Code Agent:

## Web Application with Authentication

```
Create a web application with user authentication and a REST API. The application should allow users to register, log in, and manage their profile. It should have a dashboard where users can view and edit their information. The API should provide endpoints for user management and data retrieval.

Technologies: Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, JWT, React
```

## Command Line Tool

```
Build a command-line tool for managing personal tasks and notes. The tool should allow users to add, list, update, and delete tasks and notes. It should support categories, priorities, and due dates for tasks. The data should be stored locally in a SQLite database.

Technologies: Python, Click, SQLite, Rich
```

## Mobile Application

```
Develop a mobile application for tracking fitness activities. The app should allow users to record workouts, track progress, and set goals. It should provide visualizations of workout history and progress towards goals. The app should also support user profiles and social sharing.

Technologies: React Native, Firebase, Redux
```

## Data Analysis Tool

```
Create a data analysis tool that can process CSV files, perform statistical analysis, and generate visualizations. The tool should support common data transformations, filtering, and aggregation operations. It should be able to export results in various formats (CSV, JSON, Excel).

Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
```

## E-commerce Website

```
Build an e-commerce website with product listings, shopping cart, and checkout functionality. The website should have user authentication, product search and filtering, and order history. It should also include an admin panel for managing products, orders, and users.

Technologies: JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React
```

## Chat Application

Technologies: JavaScript, Node.js, Socket.io, React, MongoDB
```

## API Gateway

```
Create an API gateway service that routes requests to appropriate microservices. The gateway should handle authentication, rate limiting, and request validation. It should also provide logging, monitoring, and caching capabilities.

Technologies: Python, FastAPI, Redis, JWT
```

## Machine Learning Pipeline

```
Build a machine learning pipeline for text classification. The pipeline should include data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. It should support multiple classification algorithms and hyperparameter tuning. The pipeline should be configurable through a configuration file.

Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Pandas, Joblib
```
