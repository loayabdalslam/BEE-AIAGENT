    "raw_plan": "## Software Development Plan: Simple Todo App with Flask\n\n**1. Project Overview:**\n\n*   **Main Objectives:**\n    *   Develop a functional and user-friendly todo application using Flask and Python.\n    *   Provide a simple and intuitive interface for managing tasks.\n    *   Ensure fast performance and responsiveness.\n    *   Create a maintainable and scalable codebase.\n*   **Key Features:**\n    *   **Task Creation:** Ability to add new tasks with a title and optional description.\n    *   **Task Listing:** Display a list of all tasks, showing their title and status (e.g., \"To Do,\" \"Completed\").\n    *   **Task Completion:** Ability to mark tasks as complete.\n    *   **Task Deletion:** Ability to remove tasks from the list.\n    *   **Task Editing:** Ability to edit existing tasks (title and description).\n*   **Target Users/Audience:**\n    *   Individuals looking for a simple and efficient way to manage their daily tasks.\n    *   Users who prefer a lightweight and easy-to-use application.\n    *   Developers looking for a basic Flask project as a learning resource.\n\n**2. Technical Architecture:**\n\n*   **Recommended Technologies and Frameworks:**\n    *   **Python:** Programming language.\n    *   **Flask:** Web framework for building the application.\n    *   **SQLite:** Lightweight database for storing todo items (suitable for simplicity).\n    *   **HTML/CSS:** For creating the user interface.\n    *   **Jinja2:** Template engine for rendering HTML pages.\n*   **System Architecture Diagram (Text Description):**\n\n    The application follows a basic Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, although in a simplified form.\n\n    *   **Model:** Represents the data and logic related to todo items (e.g., `Todo` class). Interacts with the SQLite database.\n    *   **View:**  Represents the user interface (HTML templates).  Uses Jinja2 to dynamically render data from the Model.\n    *   **Controller:**  Handles user requests (e.g., adding a task, marking as complete).  Interacts with the Model to perform data operations and updates the View.\n\n    The user interacts with the View (browser). The View sends requests to the Controller (Flask routes). The Controller interacts with the Model (database) and updates the View with the results.\n*   **Data Models and Relationships:**\n\n    *   **Todo:**\n        *   `id` (Integer, Primary Key, Autoincrement): Unique identifier for each todo item.\n        *   `title` (String, Required): Title of the todo item.\n        *   `description` (String, Optional): Detailed description of the todo item.\n        *   `completed` (Boolean, Default: False): Indicates whether the task is completed.\n\n    *   **Relationship:**  The `Todo` model is self-contained. There are no relationships to other entities in this simple application.\n\n**3. Development Phases:**\n\n*   **Phase 1: Setup and Foundation (Estimated Duration: 2 days)**\n    *   Set up the development environment (Python, Flask, necessary libraries).\n    *   Initialize the Flask application.\n    *   Create the SQLite database and define the `Todo` model.\n    *   Set up basic routing and error handling.\n    *   Create a basic HTML template structure.\n*   **Phase 2: Core Functionality (Estimated Duration: 5 days)**\n    *   Implement the task creation functionality (form, route, database interaction).\n    *   Implement the task listing functionality (query database, render tasks in HTML).\n    *   Implement the task completion functionality (route, database update).\n    *   Implement the task deletion functionality (route, database deletion).\n*   **Phase 3: Additional Features (Estimated Duration: 3 days)**\n    *   Implement the task editing functionality (form, route, database update).\n    *   Improve the user interface with CSS styling.\n    *   Add basic error handling and validation.\n    *   Implement flash messages to provide user feedback.\n*   **Phase 4: Testing and Refinement (Estimated Duration: 2 days)**\n    *   Write unit tests for core functionalities.\n    *   Perform integration testing to ensure all components work together correctly.\n    *   Conduct manual testing to identify and fix bugs.\n    *   Refactor the code for improved readability and maintainability.\n\n**4. Implementation Details:**\n\n*   **Directory Structure:**\n\n    ```\n    todo_app/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 app.py          # Main Flask application file\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 models.py       # Database models\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 forms.py        # Forms (optional, but good practice)\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 templates/\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 base.html   # Base template for common elements\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 index.html  # Template for the main todo list\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 edit.html   # Template for editing a todo\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 static/\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 style.css   # CSS stylesheet\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 tests/          # Unit tests\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 test_app.py\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 instance/\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 todo.db     # SQLite database file (not tracked by Git)\n    ```\n\n*   **Key Files and Their Purposes:**\n\n    *   `app.py`:  Contains the Flask application instance, routes, and main logic.\n    *   `models.py`: Defines the database models (e.g., `Todo` class) using SQLAlchemy (or a similar ORM).\n    *   `forms.py`: (Optional) Defines forms for creating and editing tasks using Flask-WTF or a similar library.\n    *   `templates/`:  Contains HTML templates for rendering the user interface.\n    *   `static/`: Contains static files such as CSS stylesheets and JavaScript files.\n    *   `tests/`: Contains unit tests for testing the application logic.\n    *   `instance/todo.db`: The SQLite database file (should be excluded from version control).\n\n*   **External Dependencies:**\n\n    *   `Flask`: Web framework.  Install with `pip install Flask`\n    *   `Flask-SQLAlchemy`: (Optional, but recommended) ORM for interacting with the database. Install with `pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy`\n    *   `Flask-WTF`: (Optional) For handling forms. Install with `pip install Flask-WTF`\n    *   `SQLAlchemy`: Core ORM library. Install with `pip install SQLAlchemy`\n    *   `python-dotenv`: (Optional) For managing environment variables. Install with `pip install python-dotenv`\n\n**5.
