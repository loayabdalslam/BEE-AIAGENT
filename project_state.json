    "raw_plan": "# Software Development Plan for Todo App Using React\n\n## 1. Project Overview\n\n### Main Objectives\n- Develop a user-friendly Todo application that allows users to create, manage, and track their tasks efficiently.\n- Ensure the application is responsive and accessible across different devices.\n\n### Key Features\n- User authentication (sign up, login, logout)\n- Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) tasks\n- Categorization of tasks (e.g., work, personal)\n- Task prioritization and due dates\n- Search and filter functionality\n- Dark mode and light mode toggle\n- Local storage for offline access\n- User-friendly UI with drag-and-drop functionality for task organization\n\n### Target Users/Audience\n- Individuals looking to manage their personal tasks effectively.\n- Students needing to track assignments and deadlines.\n- Professionals managing work-related tasks.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Technical Architecture\n\n### Recommended Technologies and Frameworks\n- **Frontend**: React.js, React Router, Redux (for state management), Axios (for API calls), Material-UI or Bootstrap (for UI components)\n- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js, MongoDB (for database), JWT (for authentication)\n- **Deployment**: Heroku or Vercel for hosting, GitHub for version control\n\n### System Architecture Diagram\nThe architecture consists of:\n- **Client Side**: React application that communicates with the backend via RESTful API.\n- **Server Side**: Node.js server handling API requests, managing authentication, and connecting to the MongoDB database.\n- **Database**: MongoDB storing user data and tasks.\n\n### Data Models and Relationships\n- **User Model**: \n  - Fields: id, username, password, email, tasks (array of task IDs)\n- **Task Model**: \n  - Fields: id, title, description, category, dueDate, priority, completed, userId (reference to User)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Development Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Setup and Foundation\n- Set up the project repository and initialize React application.\n- Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality.\n- Set up the backend with Node.js and Express.\n- Connect to MongoDB and set up basic user authentication.\n\n### Phase 2: Core Functionality\n- Implement user registration and authentication.\n- Develop CRUD operations for tasks.\n- Create UI components for task management.\n- Implement state management using Redux.\n\n### Phase 3: Additional Features\n- Add categorization and prioritization of tasks.\n- Implement search and filter functionality.\n- Add dark mode and light mode toggle.\n- Implement drag-and-drop functionality for task organization.\n\n### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement\n- Conduct unit and integration testing.\n- Perform user acceptance testing (UAT).\n- Gather feedback and make necessary refinements.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Implementation Details\n\n### Directory Structure\n```\n/todo-app\n  /client\n    /public\n    /src\n      /components\n      /redux\n      /pages\n      /styles\n      /utils\n      App.js\n      index.js\n  /server\n    /config\n    /controllers\n    /models\n    /routes\n    /middleware\n    server.js\n```\n\n### Key Files and Their Purposes\n- **client/src/App.js**: Main application component.\n- **client/src/index.js**: Entry point of the React application.\n- **server/server.js**: Entry point for the Node.js server.\n- **server/models/user.js**: User model definition.\n- **server/models/task.js**: Task model definition.\n- **server/routes/auth.js**: Authentication routes.\n\n### External Dependencies\n- Frontend: React, Redux, Axios, Material-UI\n- Backend: Express, Mongoose, Bcrypt, JWT\n\n---\n\n## 5. Development Tasks\n\n1. Initialize React app and Node.js server (Low)\n2. Set up ESLint and Prettier (Low)\n3. Configure MongoDB connection (Medium)\n4. Implement user registration and authentication (High)\n5. Create task model and CRUD operations (High)\n6. Set up Redux for state management (Medium)\n7. Develop UI components for task management (Medium)\n8. Implement categorization and prioritization (Medium)\n9. Add search and filter functionality (Medium)\n10. Implement dark mode and light mode toggle (Medium)\n11. Implement drag-and-drop functionality (High)\n12. Write unit tests for components and API (Medium)\n13. Conduct user acceptance testing (Medium)\n14. Deploy the application (Low)\n\n---\n\n## 6. Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Testing Approach\n- Use Jest and React Testing Library for frontend components.\n- Use Mocha and Chai for backend API testing.\n\n### Integration Testing Approach\n- Test interactions between frontend and backend using tools like Postman or Cypress.\n\n### Manual Testing Requirements\n- Test all user flows, including registration, login, task creation, and editing.\n- Validate responsiveness on various devices and browsers.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Deployment Considerations\n\n### Recommended Deployment Platform\n- **Frontend**: Vercel or Netlify\n- **Backend**: Heroku or DigitalOcean\n\n### Configuration Requirements\n- Set up environment variables for database connection and JWT secret.\n- Configure CORS for API access.\n\n### CI/CD Pipeline Suggestions\n- Use GitHub Actions for continuous integration.\n- Automate deployment to Vercel for the frontend and Heroku for the backend upon merging to the main branch.\n\n---\n\nThis structured plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for developing a Todo application using React, from initial setup to deployment. Each phase and task is designed to ensure a smooth development process, leading to a robust and user-friendly application.",
