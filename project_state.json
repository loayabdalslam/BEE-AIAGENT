    "raw_plan": "## Software Development Plan: React Todo App\n\n**1. Project Overview:**\n\n*   **Main Objectives:**\n    *   Develop a user-friendly and intuitive web application for managing personal tasks.\n    *   Provide a simple and efficient way to create, track, and complete tasks.\n    *   Offer a visually appealing and responsive user interface.\n*   **Key Features:**\n    *   **Task Creation:** Ability to add new tasks with descriptions.\n    *   **Task Listing:** Display a list of all tasks, including their status (pending, completed).\n    *   **Task Editing:** Ability to modify existing task descriptions.\n    *   **Task Completion:** Mark tasks as complete.\n    *   **Task Deletion:** Remove tasks from the list.\n    *   **Filtering/Sorting:** (Optional) Filter tasks by status (pending, completed) and sort by creation date or priority (if added later).\n    *   **Local Storage:** Persist tasks in the browser's local storage.\n*   **Target Users/Audience:**\n    *   Individuals seeking a simple and effective tool for personal task management.\n    *   Students, professionals, or anyone needing to organize their daily activities.\n\n**2. Technical Architecture:**\n\n*   **Recommended Technologies and Frameworks:**\n    *   **Frontend:** React (JavaScript library for building user interfaces)\n    *   **State Management:** React's built-in `useState` hook (for simple state management).  For more complex state management (if features are expanded later), consider Context API or Redux.\n    *   **Styling:** CSS Modules or Styled Components (for component-specific styling)\n    *   **Package Manager:** npm or yarn\n    *   **Version Control:** Git (with a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)\n*   **System Architecture Diagram (Text Description):**\n    The application follows a simple single-page application (SPA) architecture.  The React components render the user interface in the browser.  User interactions (e.g., adding a task, marking as complete) trigger state updates within the React components.  These state updates are then persisted to the browser's local storage.  When the application is reloaded, the tasks are retrieved from local storage and displayed.  The architecture is entirely client-side, with no backend server required for this basic implementation.\n*   **Data Models and Relationships:**\n    *   **Task Object:**\n        *   `id`: (String, Unique) - A unique identifier for the task (e.g., generated using `uuid` library).\n        *   `text`: (String) - The description of the task.\n        *   `completed`: (Boolean) - Indicates whether the task is completed (true) or pending (false).\n\n    *   **Relationship:**  There are no explicit relationships between different data models in this simple application.  The `Task` objects are stored as an array in the application's state.\n\n**3. Development Phases:**\n\n*   **Phase 1: Setup and Foundation (1-2 days)**\n    *   Set up the React project using `create-react-app`.\n    *   Configure basic project structure and directory organization.\n    *   Install necessary dependencies (e.g., `uuid` if used for generating IDs).\n    *   Create initial components (e.g., `App`, `TaskList`, `TaskItem`, `TaskForm`).\n    *   Implement basic styling and layout.\n*   **Phase 2: Core Functionality (3-5 days)**\n    *   Implement task creation functionality (using `TaskForm`).\n    *   Implement task listing functionality (using `TaskList` and `TaskItem`).\n    *   Implement task completion functionality (updating the `completed` status).\n    *   Implement task deletion functionality.\n    *   Implement local storage persistence (saving and retrieving tasks).\n*   **Phase 3: Additional Features (2-3 days)**\n    *   (Optional) Implement task editing functionality.\n    *   (Optional) Implement filtering/sorting functionality.\n    *   Improve styling and user interface.\n    *   Add error handling and user feedback (e.g., displaying messages).\n*   **Phase 4: Testing and Refinement (1-2 days)**\n    *   Write unit tests for key components and functions.\n    *   Perform integration testing to ensure components work together correctly.\n    *   Conduct manual testing to identify and fix any bugs or usability issues.\n    *   Refactor code for improved readability and maintainability.\n\n**4.

Install using: `npm install uuid` or `yarn add uuid`\n    *   (Optional) `styled-components` or CSS Modules for styling.\n\n**5.
